    <h2>RECLAIM YOUR SEXUAL HEALTH AND STRENGTHEN YOUR RELATIONSHIP</h2>

    <p>Erectile Dysfunction (ED) is a man's condition, but a couple's concern. ED can be a pretty heavy topic. At times one that can be embarrassing to discuss with your partner. Some men that we treat choose to keep the treatment private and never share any of the information. There is nothing wrong with this approach, and we will work diligently to ensure your privacy is honored.</p>

    <p>Talking about ED with your partner is very important. In fact, your partner may be waiting for you to bring up the subject. As with any part of a relationship, communication is key.</p>

    <p>"Women internalize things -- they tend to blame themselves first, thinking it's because they have done something wrong, or that they are no longer attractive to their partner. In fact, the first thing a woman thinks when a man can't get an erection is that it's her fault, and nothing could be further from the truth," says Andrew McCullough, MD, director of sexual health and male infertility at NYU Medical Center in New York City.</p>

    <p>Your partner will most likely be more supportive than you ever thought. The common goal is that you both want a happy and healthy relationship and intimacy is a key part of that. Create a strategy together. Some couples even join their men for the appointment at Superior Medical Solutions.</p>

    <p>ED is not a condition you have to live with! It is usually fully treatable. Let Superior Medical Solutions help you improve your sex life and create happy healthy harmony within your relationship.</p>

    <p>With your partner's support, you can realize that sexual intimacy is an important part of your life together, and see your erectile dysfunction and/or premature ejaculation as a physical problem, not a sexual or masculine shortcoming. This will make it easier for you to do something about it - together. And that's definitely something worth talking about.</p>

    <p>If you do not have a partner, you may choose to have your problem treated before it progresses any further. Also, knowing that you have solved your problem will often give you the confidence to find a partner.</p>
