      <h2>What is Erectile Dysfunction (ED)?</h2>

      <p>Erectile dysfunction commonly referred to as ED, is the inability to achieve and sustain an erection suitable for sexual intercourse. This condition is not considered normal at any age.</p>

      <div class="section-white">
        <p
          class="mb-0"
        >A study reported in the International Journal of Impotence Research, March/April 2005 discussed how widespread ED really is:</p>
        <ul class="list mb-1">
          <li>Affects over 30 million men and their partners in the US</li>
          <li>Impacts 52% of men over 40 years of age</li>
          <li>Affects 70% of men in their 70s</li>
          <li>Hinders 40% of men in their 40s with occasional problems</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <v-row>
        <v-col cols="12" lg="6">
          <p>Doctors can prescribe treatments to help, but many men don't discuss ED with their doctors. "It is estimated that close to 90% of ED sufferers are still reluctant to visit their family doctors because of embarrassment," says the study. Superior Medical Solutions takes the embarrassment out of ED. We specialize in privacy and make our patients feel safe and comfortable.</p>
          <p>Within the evolution of our clinic, we have found that men waste an amazing amount of time and money buying over the counter remedies such as herbal and mineral solutions that don't work. Stop wasting your money and seek professional medical help. We can treat most forms of ED on your first visit to our office. Our doctors have achieved a success rate of 96%.</p>

      <h3>What are the signs of erectile dysfunction?</h3>
      <div class="section-white">
        <ul class="list">
          <li>
            Erection problems
            <br />(achieving or maintaining an erection) occurring at least one in every four times of attempting sexual intercourse
          </li>
          <li>Achieving an erection taking longer than usual</li>
          <li>Losing an erection in certain positions</li>
          <li>Morning erections becoming less common or less rigid</li>
          <li>Ejaculating more rapidly or with an incomplete erection</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p>In order to achieve and maintain an erection three conditions must occur: The nerves to the penis must be functioning properly; the blood circulation to the penis must be adequate; there must be a stimulus from the brain. If there is something interfering with any or all of these conditions, a full erection will be prevented.</p>

      <p>
        Don't settle for mediocrity. ED is
        <span class="bold">NOT normal</span> in older men and should NOT be accepted as a normal part of aging. In fact, ED should not be tolerated by a man of any age. At Superior Medical Solutions, there is no age limit to the people we can help. The oldest patient that we have treated is 92!
        The most commonly known medications for ED are oral medications such as Viagra, Levitra, and Cialis. There are many more treatments approved by the FDA. Superior Medical Solutions will find the right medication or a combination of medications that are right for you and your condition. The oral medications can be effective, however many times they are not the most effective.
      </p>

      <p>The fact is that men and their health conditions are individualized. Therefore, the treatments for ED also need to be individualized. For example, a treatment designed for a man with a heart condition would be very different from one designed for a relatively healthy person. We are actually able to help men with a variety of medical conditions such as heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, prostate cancer, and the list goes on. Our physicians will provide you with the safest and most effective medications.</p>

      <h2>What is Premature Ejaculation (PE)?</h2>

          <p>According to the research in the field of Sexual dysfunction, Premature ejaculation (PE) is the most common sexual dysfunction complaint in men younger than 40 years. Most professionals who treat PE define this condition as the occurrence of ejaculation prior to the wishes of both sexual partners.</p>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>PE is estimated to affect 18 million men and their partners in the US</li>
            <li>PE is most common in younger men (aged 18-30)</li>
            <li>PE may also occur in conjunction with secondary impotence in men aged 45-65 years</li>
            <li>PE can and will be a life long problem if not treated</li>

Most professionals who treat PE define this condition as the occurrence of ejaculation prior to the wishes of both sexual partners.
        PE is estimated to affect 18 million men and their partners in the US
        PE is most common in younger men (aged 18-30)
        PE may also occur in conjunction with secondary impotence in men aged 45-65 years
        PE can and will be a life long problem if not treated
        Researchers in the field of sexual dysfunction have found differences in nerve conduction in men who experience PE causing hyper-excitability or oversensitivity of their genitalia. PE can also be exacerbated by apprehension or lack of confidence in satisfying your partner.
      </p>

      <h3>PE Complications:</h3>
      <div class="section-white">
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Severe PE can cause stress within a marriage or other relationship, which might contribute to conflicts and separation or divorce in some cases.</li>
          <li>Conception is also difficult in cases of PE before vaginal intromission.</li>
          <li>PE can and will be a life long problem if not treated.</li>
          <li>PE can eventually lead to erection problems later in life.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p>Superior Medical Solutions uses FDA approved medications to treat PE. By using these medications over time, the nerve endings will become less and less sensitive, providing longer sexual sessions before your orgasm, until ultimately the medication is no longer needed.</p>

      >CAUTION!! ALTERNATIVE AND NATURAL REMEDIES CAN BE VERY DANGEROUS!</p>

      <h3>According to Reuters Health, a highly regarded medical resource:</h3>

      <blockquote class="blockquote">
        "It should be strongly noted that alternative or natural remedies are not regulated and their quality is not publicly controlled. In addition, any substance that can affect the body's chemistry can, like any drug, produce side effects that may be harmful. There have been a number of reported cases of serious and even lethal side effects from so-called natural products.
        For example, some products are marketed for improving sexual function (Verve, Jolt) that contains gamma-butyrolactone (GBL). This substance can convert to a chemical that can cause toxic and life-threatening effects, including seizures and even coma.
        In addition, some so-called natural remedies have been found to contain standard prescription medication. Most problems reported occurring in herbal remedies imported from Asia, with one study reporting a significant percentage of such remedies containing toxic metals. Even if studies report positive benefits, most, to date, are very small. In addition, the substances used in such studies are, in most cases, not what is being marketed to the public.
        The Food and Drug Administration has a program called MEDWATCH for people to report adverse reactions to untested substances, such as herbal remedies and vitamins (call
        <a

        >800-332-1088</a>)."
      </blockquote>

      <p>It is our recommendation as a professional medical corporation, that an individual seeking treatment for any form of erectile dysfunction contact a licensed medical doctor.</p>
      <p>Superior Medical Solutions has only Colorado Licensed and Board Certified Physicians on staff who specialize in Erectile Dysfunction. We prescribe only FDA approved medications.</p>
